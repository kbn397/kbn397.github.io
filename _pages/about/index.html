I’m Khai, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://stat.utexas.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Data Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nhat Ho</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/15-mathematics/364-mueller-peter?Itemid=1259" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Peter Müller</a>, and to be associated with Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (<a href="https://www.ifml.institute/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IFML</a>). I graduated from <a href="https://soict.hust.edu.vn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> with a Computer Science Bachelor’s degree. Before joining UT Austin, I was an AI Research Resident at <a href="http://www.vinai.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VinAI Research</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Hung Bui</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://khainb.github.io/assets/intro.gif" alt="GIF description" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></p> <p><em>(This video is created by my proposed <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13586.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">energy-based sliced Wasserstein distance</a>.)</em></p> <p><strong>Research:</strong> My research focuses on both fundamental problems and applied problems in probabilistic machine learning, deep learning, and statistics.</p> <p><strong><em>1. Computational Optimal Transport.</em></strong> My research makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Optimal Transport</a> scalable in statistical inference (low time complexity, low space complexity, low sample complexity) via the one-dimensional projection approach which is known as sliced optimal transport (sliced Wasserstein distance). My work focuses on three key aspects of sliced Wasserstein: numerical approximation, projecting operator, and slicing distribution.</p> <p><strong><em>2. Efficiency, Scalability, Interpretability, and Trustworthiness of AI.</em></strong> My research enhances the performance of 3D vision models, speeds up the training of generative models, adapts prediction models to new unseen domains, explains multimodal transferable representation, and ensures fairness and robustness in learning processes.</p> </body></html>
